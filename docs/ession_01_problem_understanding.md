# Session 1 — Problem Understanding 

**High-level goal (as stated): ** Quantify a data-driven Financial Health Index (FHI) for SMEs - a composite measure that classifies businesses into Low, Medium, or High financial health 
across four key dimensions: savings and assets, debt and repayment ability, resilience to shocks, and access to credit and financial services.

## 2. Problem in My Own Words
SMEs often face challenges when it comes to access to traditional financial and credit facilities, due to their suceptibility to economic shocks, climatic conditions that influence their revenue and profitability from one month to the next.
However revenue and profitability, these bottom line outcomes which can show so much volatility for such institutions shoould not be the only measures of financial health specifically for SMEs.
Surely, demographics, Size, ability to repay loans* and reselience* of a business could shed more light.
